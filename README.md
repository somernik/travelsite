## Problem Statement/Goal
Sometimes you just don't know what activities to plan for a given location and time of year. For example, you know you are taking a trip to Florida in October, but what activities are best to do then? By combining user ratings, geographic locations and time-of-year data this site analyzes user preferences and history to determine the where, what and when of your next trip!
